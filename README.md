# useState-practice

I utilized the playground functionality from Codedamn.com which allowed me to create a React App within a browser.

To better understand how to setup and use State hooks in React, I created a small web application with 2 sections.

The first section is a random number generator and it allows a user to increase or decrease the number shown on the web application.

The second section is a random name generator which allows the user to click the button which updates the name shown on the web application.
